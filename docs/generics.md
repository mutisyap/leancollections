# Generics
* It means parameterized types.
* It allows us to use Java specific Objects (Integer, String, ...) and user defined types to be 
parameters to methods, classes and interfaces.

## Why not just use the Object?
- Because we will have to type cast everytime, and this can fail.
- Generics add type safety.
